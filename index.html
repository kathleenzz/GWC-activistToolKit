          <i><strong>Repair versus Replacement: </strong></i>
          <br>
          <br>
         The average life-expectancy of a cellphone is about five years.  However, an average user in the United States upgrades within 22 months.  With companies like Apple releasing new products into the market every year, it's really easy to ride the latest trends of remodeled devices.  Overconsumerism is a growing issue and there is a definite emphasis on replacement than repairs.
         Many companies also like to focus on hardware upgrades rather software upgrades.  This means that the consumer would have to replace equipment to receive new updates.

          <i><strong> Depletion of Natural Resources: </strong> </i>
          <br>
          <br>
         Precious metals like Gold and Silver and raw materials such as Cobalt, Coal, and fossil fuels are instrumental in making and running digital devices.  As the demand for urbanization across the world increase, mining for more non-renewable, raw materials will only get harder in the future.  Not to mention, the obvious explotation of the miners in developing nations, but that is another topic within itself.

         <p class="factContainer1"> <strong> An overall increase in Energy Consumption </strong> 
         <br>
         <br>
         Manufacturers and data banks run on a lot of energy to make digital devices, <i> run </i>.  This increase in energy consumption induces more burning of fossil fuels (a non-renewable material).  Thus, more carbon emissions are released into the atmosphere adding on to the other contributers of Global Warming/Climate Change.
         
         <p class ="factContainer2"> <strong> eWaste </strong>
          <br>
         The UNEP estimates that there are roughly 40 million metric tons electronic waste produced globally.  To put things in perspective, that is 1,500 as heavy as the Statue of Liberty!  Or Seven times as heavy as the Great Pyramids of Giza. 
         <br>
         <br>
         It is one of fastest growing source of waste due to the rapid modernization of the world.  eWaste must be disposed off properly in order for it to not contaminate the soil and nearby ground water and crops.
         The heavy metals such as barium, lead, mercury, and lithium from batteries and devices are extremely harmful when disposed off improperly. Not only it is a Global Enviromental hazard, it is also a health hazard.  The final destination of 70% of eWaste is unreported, and many experts agree that it is illegally exported to developing nations where it is picked apart and burned for valuable parts such as gold and copper.  These "open-air" incenarators create fine particles that pollute the air and cause problems in lungs if inhaled.
